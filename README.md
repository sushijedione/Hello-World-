# Hello-World-
Test project. 
Hey there, Wee here. Learning how git works, trying new things. I came from a culinary backgound and now in transition into the developer role. My favorite types of food are Asian influenced, such as Chinese, Japanese, Southeast Asian and more. 
As a way for me to learn Github I am uplodaing some of my favorite collection of recipes in the a repo. Please feel free to browse, make changes or comment. 
Thanks, Wee
